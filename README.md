This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when developing React Native apps with Expo's managed workflow. The error occurs when developers try to incorporate native modules, which are not directly compatible with the managed workflow.  This example highlights the problem and offers a solution involving either ejecting from the managed workflow or using Expo's alternatives for accessing native features.
