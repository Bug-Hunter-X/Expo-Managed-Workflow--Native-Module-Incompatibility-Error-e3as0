This error typically arises when you are working with Expo's managed workflow and attempting to use native modules or functionalities that are not directly supported within the managed environment.  The Expo Go client, or the managed build process, might lack the necessary capabilities to handle such a module. This frequently leads to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the app attempts to use the unsupported functionality.
