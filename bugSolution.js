There are several ways to resolve this, each with tradeoffs:

**1. Eject from Expo Managed Workflow:**
This grants full control over native modules, but sacrifices the convenience and streamlined setup of the managed workflow.  It's a more involved process.

**2. Use Expo's Alternatives:**
Expo provides various APIs to access device features like camera, location, and more. These are generally preferred as they often abstract away the complexity of native code. If a compatible Expo API exists, it's the recommended solution.  Check Expo's documentation for alternatives.

**3. Use a Compatible Library:**
Some libraries are specifically designed to work within the Expo managed workflow.  Search for libraries that provide the desired functionality and are explicitly compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Assume a dependency on a module 'react-native-nfc-manager' which is not directly compatible with Expo Managed workflow.

**bug.js (Illustrative problem):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import NfcManager from 'react-native-nfc-manager';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Checking NFC ...</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**bugSolution.js (Solution with Expo alternative, if one exists):**
```javascript
// Replace with the equivalent Expo library or native module wrapper if available.
// If no Expo alternative exists, consider ejection.
```

**Example (if no Expo alternative exists):**

You'd need to eject from Expo and use native modules according to React Native guidelines.
